# NOTE  
this front-end is coded using the JS framework ReactJS as you can check in the files uploaded here,
using also the bootstrap libraries and buttons and forms to make it the UI more representative of 
what it is supposed to represent for the users ! 
in the process of learning about project management and team work and how to make more interactive UIs 
that make things easier for users specifically those who work in adminstrations; 
who struggles a lot with data displaying and the lack of functionalities or the absence of the interactions 
avec the software while using it which makes their work a little harder to do on paper 
meanwhile it's better to digitize things for them ^^ 
currently it has three profils which is of a student and an adminstrator and a teacher or another employee 
that makes the app useful for each one of them.
feel free to use it :)
